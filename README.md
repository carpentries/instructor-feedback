# Instructor Feedback Reports
This repository was created to develop instructor feedback reports using Carpentries pre and post survey data.

# Short Project Description
Develop a workflow to provide feedback to Carpentries’ instructors for coaching after they’ve taught a workshop.
See [this issue](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-development/issues/70) for
