# Instructor Feedback Reports
This repository was created to develop instructor feedback reports using Carpentries pre and post survey data.

# Short project description
Develop a workflow to provide feedback to Carpentries’ instructors for coaching after they’ve taught a workshop.
See [carpentries/instructor-development#70](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-development/issues/70) for
initial discussion.

# Rationale
We'd like to provide instructors with a useful report from their workshops as part of instructor professional development.
